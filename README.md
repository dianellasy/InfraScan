# InfraScan

Road Infrastructure Issue Detection System

Current Phase:
	- Architectural Design and Planning

## Branching

`main` is the source of truth. `frontend-dev` and `backend-dev` are the long-lived development branches.

To start a change, check out the branch for your area and create your working branch from it:

```bash
git checkout frontend-dev   # or backend-dev
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

## Architecture Checklist

- [-] System Context Diagram (C4 Level 1) (DONE - 10/13)
- [-] Container Diagram (C4 Level 2) (DONE - 10/13)
- [-] Component Diagrams (Backend, Inference) (DONE - 10/15)
- [-] API Design and Interface Definitions (DONE - 10/12)
- [-] Technology Stack and Justifications (DONE - 10/12)
- [-] Database Schema / ERD (DONE - 12/14)
- [ ] Deployment Architecture (proposed edge, cloud, or hybrid) (TBD)

Still need to consider
- main statistics to display
- UI flow for frontend

## Backend API

The FastAPI contract is versioned under `/api/v1` and declares the API routes
and Pydantic DTOs described in the architecture design:

| Method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/inference/jobs` |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/api/v1/issues` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/issues/review-queue` |
| `GET`, `PATCH` | `/api/v1/issues/{issue_id}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/jobs` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/detections` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/roads` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/roads/{road_id}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/roads/{road_id}/issues` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/detections` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/detections/{detection_id}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/detections/{detection_id}/evidence` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/overview` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/road-conditions` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/geographic` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/damage-distribution` |

The API handlers depend on the `InfraScanService` contract in
`backend/app/services/contracts.py`. Infrastructure boundaries for media
storage, inference-job persistence, task queuing, and domain repositories are
declared in `backend/app/adapters/ports.py`. Concrete service and adapter
implementations are not configured yet; until an application service is
attached to `app.state.infrascan_service`, API calls return `503 Service
Unavailable` rather than successful placeholder data.

Install backend dependencies with `python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.
Run the API from the backend directory with `uvicorn main:app --reload`; the
interactive API schema is available at `/docs`.

For local frontend development, the API allows cross-origin requests from
`http://localhost:5173`.
